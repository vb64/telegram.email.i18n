# Viewing the list of voters in EmailGateBot

In polls created with the bot, the button is added: 'Who has voted?'.

Follows this button you can see a list of the latest votes in the poll.
Each vote is a link to the Telegram profile of the voter.
If more than 10 people voted in the poll, buttons are automatically added to the list to go to the next/previous page of the voter list.

When viewing the list of voters in the poll results, you can forward a contact from the list or a message from any Telegram user to a private chat with a bot.
The bot will tell you how this contact or user voted in the poll.
